# Describe the differences between declarative and programmatic customisations

In Salesforce, the difference between declarative customizations and programmatic customizations is a how they're implemented and how they're supported. Declarative 
customizations are implemented via a point and click interface provided by Salesforce. When Salesforce is updated, these customizations are also automatically updated 
to function properly and be compliant with the new updates. In other words, the technical debt falls on Salesforce, not the developers. On the other hand, we may need 
a more flexible or specific features implemented that aren't provided by the declarative options. In this case, we would use the programmatic options. With 
programmatic updated, it is the developer's responsibility to maintain the code, increasing our technical debt.
